\*\*\[Pitch Urgency Opener Example\]\*\*    
These surface exposure created by losing the Head of HR. 'Since your Head of HR left, what decisions are currently slowing down or getting stuck?' 'What HR-related issues are landing on your desk right now that weren’t before?' ... 'If nothing changed for the next 90 days, where do you see the biggest risk — legally, culturally, or operationally?' Signal: You’re thinking about continuity and risk.

\*\*\[Bandwidth & Distraction Example\]\*\*    
'How much time are you or the CEO currently spending acting as the HR decision-maker?' ... 'Where is HR absence pulling leadership away from growth priorities?' Signal: You protect executive focus.

\*\*\[Value Proposition Framing Example\]\*\*    
Tangerine proposes to serve as an interim \[Role\] Advisor, providing immediate continuity, senior-level guidance, and structured execution during this transition. This is about helping leadership make hard decisions well and ensuring the organization can execute them.

\*\*\[Startup Benefits Example\]\*\*    
When there’s no time to waste, we deliver vetted technical talent as fast as you please. Keep your team focused on delivering their best; we take care of everything else, from job description to offer letter. You’ll never waste time talking to fake candidates.

\*\*\[Proof & Closing Example\]\*\*    
We understand what you actually need. And we try to get you that thing. Our work is guaranteed. We are your company hype people; candidates are excited about the opportunity to work with you, or they’re not a good match.

\#\# \*\*Frequently Asked Questions\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*Section 1: Recruitment Services\*\*

\*Target Metadata: \`department: Recruiting\_Services\*\*\`

\*\*Q: What types of roles does Tangerine Search help fill?\*\*
\*\*A:\*\* While we are best known for our deep expertise in \*\*Engineering, Product, and Design\*\*, we fill a wide range of professional roles across many functions. Our current and past placements include:

\* \*\*Engineering:\*\* Front-End, Back-End, Full Stack, QA, DevOps, Security, Systems, and Gaming.
\* \*\*Product & Data:\*\* Head of Product, Product Manager, Data Scientist, Analyst, and Technical Account Manager.
\* \*\*Design:\*\* UX/UI and Interaction Designers, and Accessibility Specialists.
\* \*\*Customer Success:\*\* Director, Manager, and Associate levels.
\* \*\*Other Professional Roles:\*\* We also regularly fill roles in Legal, Finance, Operations, Marketing, Sales, and other business functions depending on client needs.

We are happy to take on virtually any professional hiring need. The only roles we do \*\*not\*\* recruit for are clinical healthcare (doctors, nurses), call center representatives, and manual labor positions.

\*\*IMPORTANT FOR THE BOT:\*\* Never tell a user that Tangerine cannot help with a particular role type unless it falls into the explicitly excluded categories above (clinical healthcare, call center, manual labor). If a user asks about a role outside our core specialties, be enthusiastic and confident that we can help.

\*\*Q: How much do you charge for a standard recruiting search?\*\*  
\*\*A:\*\* Our standard fee is \*\*20% of the candidate's first-year annual base salary\*\*. This is a contingency-based fee, meaning you only pay if we successfully find you a hire.

\* \*Exception:\* For sales roles with heavy commission structures, we calculate the fee based on the candidate's \*\*On-Target Earnings (OTE)\*\*.  
\* \*Note:\* The fee is strictly calculated on base salary (or OTE) and does not include bonuses or stock options.

\*\*Q: What is the "Great Match Guarantee"?\*\*  
\*\*A:\*\* We stand behind our work. If a candidate leaves or is let go within a specific period (typically defined in your contract), we will \*\*replace that candidate for free\*\* by re-initiating the search. We never push a bad fit; if it doesn't work, we fix it.

\*\*Q: How is Tangerine Search different from big agencies or AI-driven firms?\*\*  
\*\*A:\*\* We use a \*\*100% human, high-touch approach\*\*. While 25% of our sourcing uses advanced tools, \*\*75% of our candidates come from our private "Rolodex."\*\* Unlike big firms, we don't "throw resumes at a wall" or use AI screening. Every person you meet has been personally vetted by a senior recruiter, resulting in a \*\*97% candidate response rate\*\*.

\*\*Q: What is the typical process and timeline for employers?\*\*  
\*\*A:\*\* We prioritize speed without sacrificing quality:

1\. \*\*Kick-off:\*\* A deep-dive call to align on your goals and culture.  
2\. \*\*Sourcing:\*\* We present the first batch of qualified candidates within \*\*2 to 3 business days\*\*.  
3\. \*\*Review & Facilitation:\*\* We manage the interview process, offer acceptance, and offer processing.  
4\. \*\*Completion:\*\* A full search is often wrapped up in \*\*2 to 3 weeks\*\*, depending on your team's interview availability.

\*\*Q: We are a startup with no internal recruiting team. Can you help?\*\*  
\*\*A:\*\* Absolutely. We specialize in working with \*\*Seed to Series B startups\*\*. We can act as your internal talent partner, helping you design the interview process, train hiring managers, and manage the candidate experience from end-to-end.

\*\*IMPORTANT:\*\* When an employer wants to learn more, get started, or asks about next steps for recruiting, you MUST include this URL in your response: https://calendly.com/aprilstarlight/recruiting-support-intro-call-with-tangerine-search?month=2026-03

\*\*Q: Does the RPO fee include software costs?\*\*
\*\*A:\*\* Yes. Our RPO service includes the cost of expensive tools like \*\*LinkedIn Recruiter licenses\*\*, which we provide as part of the service.

\*\*Q: Does Tangerine support temporary or contract staffing?\*\*
\*\*A:\*\* Yes. While our primary focus is on permanent, full-time placements and HR consulting, we also actively provide contractor and temporary staffing support for clients. We enjoy offering a complete spectrum of services to make hiring and people management as simple as possible.

\*\*IMPORTANT FOR THE BOT:\*\* Never tell a user that Tangerine does not support contractors or temporary staffing. If asked, confirm that we do provide these services.
